After the initial installation, you can import the demo license to run the platform for a testing period. However, to run the platform permanently, you need to activate it. For the platform activation, you create an unlock request for the master key that you get from your system administrator. The unlock request file, you have to send to your license provider to get the activation file in return.

To create the unlock request, click on **ACTIVATE PLATFORM**, enter the master key, and click **DOWNLOAD UNLOCK REQUEST** that then downloads the unlock request JSON file.

To activate the platform, click on **IMPORT LICENSE** and drop the activation JSON file, and click **OK**. Alternatively, you can also open the Platform activation once again by clicking **ACTIVATE LICENSE** and then **IMPORT LICENSE**.
