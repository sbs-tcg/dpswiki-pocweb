The license type defines the environment type. An environment is either a development (DEV, a quality assurance / test (TEST), or a production (PROD) system. The first platform license that you deploy to an environment defines its type. 

The activity licenses that you deploy to that environment must have the same license type. You can't deploy an activity license to an environment that has a different license type.
