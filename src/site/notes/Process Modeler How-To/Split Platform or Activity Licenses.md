You can split only licenses that have the status **Available**. If needed, you can retract the license from an environment and split it then.

 >[!important]
 >The ability to split or merge a license is license-specific. This feature is enabled when the license is created. The shortcut in the toolbar is displayed only, if the selected license has this feature enabled. Only admin users can maintain licenses.

1. To split a platform license, switch to the Process Modeler Licenses mode.
    
2. Select the license you want to split from the list of available platform licenses. You can only split licenses that are available.
    
3. From the Actions column, click ... and then **Split** from the context menu. The **Split Licenses** window is displayed and shows the name and the volume counters for the new licenses.
    
4. Optionally, adjust the provided settings by changing the name of the resulting licenses for Split License 1 and Split License 2 columns and the volume counters accordingly.
    
5. Click **OK**, to create from the original license two new licenses or **CANCEL** to close the window.
