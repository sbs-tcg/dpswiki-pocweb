You can delete a license from the system that is not deployed to an environment and therefore, has the status **Available**. If you want to delete a license that is already deployed, you have to retract it first and then delete it by selecting **Delete** from the **Actions** column. Though the license is deleted you can still see its Audit data, by clicking the **Licenses** tab that then shows audit data for all licenses, also the deleted ones.

 >[!important]
 >Only admin users can delete licenses.

1. To delete a platform or an activity license, switch to the Process Modeler Licenses mode.
    
2. Select the license you want to delete from the list of available platform or activity licenses.
    
    > **Note** You can delete only licenses that have the status **Available**.
    
3. Click Actions column and then select **Delete**. The **Delete** window is displayed.
    
4. Click **OK**, to delete the license from the list of available licenses or **CANCEL** to close the window without deleting the selected license. After the license is successfully deleted, the "Deletion receipt" JSON file is automatically downloaded that serves as evidence that you have properly removed the license from the system.
    

>[!important]
>Store the deletion receipt file and send it to your vendor on request.
