To be able to protect a process with a password, you require a designtime password license (see[[Process Modeler User Guide/Licenses/License modes#Password\|License modes#Password]] for more info). 

Depending on the password license in your system, you can either protect all processes with a password or specific processes only. If you can protect a process, the **Add password** action is displayed for a process version on the **Versions** tab of a selected process.

1. Click **Processes** mode and navigate to a process.
    
2. Edit the process by clicking ![Start editing](https://vm-kjciahdikcy/ProcessModeler/assets/help/img/icons/start_editing_mode_24.png). You may have to create a new draft version to be able to edit the process.
    
3. Change to the **Versions** tab by clicking the tab.  
    A list of all process versions is displayed. Processes that have a password-protection already have a check mark in the **Password** column ![Password column](https://vm-kjciahdikcy/ProcessModeler/assets/help/img/icons/key_24.png "Password column").
    
4. To add a password, select **Add password** from the Actions column. The **Add process password** window is displayed.
    
5. Enter an "administrator" password in the **Administrator process password** text field. This password is required. A user that provides the password can add more user passwords and can remove the password protection.
    
6. Add another "user" password by clicking **ADD EXTRA PASSWORD** and entering the text for the user password. To remove the user password, click **REMOVE PASSWORD**.
    
7. Click **OK** to create the password-protection or click **CANCEL** to close the window without deleting the password.
